A classical greedy snake game in command window by C++.

All files include 6 header files, 6 corresponding resource files and 1 main resource file.
After loading all file, we can start running. No external packages are needed.
I have tested on my computer and it runs successfully.
If the program fails to run, please let me know. 

The video explaining how the program works is:

Follow the instructions, use up, down, left, and right on the keyboard to select or
control the snake movement. Try to eat as mush food as you can to get score. 
Game is over when the snake hits the wall or hits itself.

After program finishes, a csv file will be created in the same fold as the project.
The csv file contains the records of each player's scores from higest to lowest.
If you played multiple times, then there will be multiple records in the file and 
your highest score is at top.
